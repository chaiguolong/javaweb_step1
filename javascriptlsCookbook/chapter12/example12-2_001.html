				There is a language 'little known,'<br />
				Lovers claim it as their own.
			</p>
			<p>
				Its symbols smile upon the land, <br />
				Wrought by nature's wondrous hand;
			</p>
			<p>
				And in their silent beauty speak,<br />
				Of life and joy, to those who seek.
			</p>
			<p>
				For Love Divine and sunny hours <br />
				In the language of the flowers.
